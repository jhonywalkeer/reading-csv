## ðŸ’» Project summary

Reading and manipulating data from a `.csv` file using Node.js with Typescript and inserting it into the database.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

Project was built using **Node.js**, **Typescript**, **Prisma** and the following dependencies:

- **[Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)** - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.

- **[Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)** - Is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency.

- **[EsLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)** - Is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions.

- **[Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)** - Is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

- **[TS Node Dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-dev)** - It restarts target node process when any of required files changes (as standard node-dev) but shares Typescript compilation process between restarts.

## ðŸ”¨ Local Installation

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 10 or higher, but if you want to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) you can also just have it on your computer to continue.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhonywalkeer/reading-csv.git

$ cd reading-csv
$ npm install or yarn install
```

And now to run our api locally just run the following command:

```bash
$ cd reading-csv
$ npm dev or yarn dev
```
